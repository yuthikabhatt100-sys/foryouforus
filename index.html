    This is for you.<br><br>

    Even though I am flawed.<br>
    Even though I hurt you sometimes by miscommunicating.<br>
    Even though I make you feel misunderstood, unseen, or sad at times.<br>
    Even though we fight.<br><br>

    I am aware of it.<br>
    I am willing to change.<br>
    I want to hold on to you and to us.<br><br>

    I love you. Always.
